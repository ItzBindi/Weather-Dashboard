# Weather-Dashboard


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What motivated me to create this application was to enhance my skills in development and working with API's.
- The reason I built this was  because it gave me an oppurtunity to go through an API with a lot of data and be able to pull only what I want from it.
- This solves the problem of planning out your week based on weather conditions.
